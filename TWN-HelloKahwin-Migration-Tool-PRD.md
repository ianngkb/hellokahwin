# Product Requirements Document: TWN to HelloKahwin Content Migration Tool

## Project Title
**TWN Content Migration & Translation Desktop Application**

## Background
The content localization landscape for WordPress-based publishing has evolved rapidly, with organizations needing to maintain multiple language versions of their content to reach diverse audiences. Currently, the manual process of migrating and translating content between WordPress sites creates significant operational bottlenecks and quality concerns.

The market for content management automation tools has grown substantially, with organizations increasingly seeking solutions that preserve SEO integrity while scaling content operations. This need is particularly acute for organizations managing content across English and Malay markets, where maintaining consistent brand messaging and technical SEO requirements is critical for audience engagement and search visibility.

This initiative addresses a critical operational gap that currently limits content publishing velocity and introduces unnecessary risk through manual processes.

## Problem Statement
**Primary Problem**: The manual migration of TWN (English) WordPress content to HelloKahwin (Malay site) creates significant operational inefficiencies and quality risks that limit publishing velocity and scale.

**Specific Pain Points**:
- **Time Inefficiency**: Manual content migration takes 15-20 minutes per post, limiting daily publishing capacity to 10-15 articles maximum
- **Error Susceptibility**: Manual translation and formatting introduces inconsistencies in SEO elements, taxonomy mapping, and content structure
- **Scalability Constraints**: Current process cannot handle bulk content migration requirements (100+ posts) without significant resource allocation
- **Quality Inconsistency**: Manual processes result in varying translation quality and missed SEO optimization opportunities
- **Resource Drain**: Editors spend 60-70% of time on mechanical migration tasks rather than content strategy and quality improvement

**User Impact**: Content editors and project managers experience daily frustration with repetitive, error-prone tasks that prevent focus on higher-value editorial work.

## Objectives & Goals
**Primary Objective**: Reduce content migration time by 80% while improving translation consistency and preserving SEO integrity.

**SMART Goals**:
- **Specific**: Automate TWN to HelloKahwin content migration with machine translation and bulk processing capabilities
- **Measurable**: Process 100+ posts in under 2 hours (vs. current 25+ hours manual process)
- **Achievable**: Leverage existing WordPress REST APIs and proven machine translation services
- **Relevant**: Directly addresses primary operational bottleneck limiting content publishing scale
- **Time-bound**: MVP delivery within 12 weeks, full feature set within 16 weeks

**Success Criteria**:
- Migration time per post reduced from 15-20 minutes to 2-3 minutes
- Translation error rate reduced by 60% through consistent automation
- Editor time allocation shifted from 70% mechanical tasks to 30% mechanical, 70% strategic

## Proposed Solution / Big Idea
**Core Concept**: A desktop application that creates an automated pipeline for bulk content migration and translation between WordPress sites, preserving SEO integrity while providing editorial oversight and quality control.

**Value Proposition**:
- **Efficiency**: Bulk processing capabilities with progress tracking and retry mechanisms
- **Quality**: Consistent machine translation with side-by-side preview for editorial review
- **Integrity**: Maintains WordPress structure, taxonomies, and SEO elements during migration
- **Control**: Local operation with editorial approval workflow before publishing
- **Reliability**: Idempotent operations with comprehensive error handling and recovery

**Key Differentiators**:
- Local-only operation eliminates data security concerns
- WordPress-native integration preserves all content relationships and metadata
- Editorial workflow integration maintains quality control while automating mechanical tasks

## User Stories / Use Cases

### Primary Persona: Content Editor
**Role**: Day-to-day content migration and quality review
**Goals**: Efficient content processing with maintained quality standards

**User Stories**:
1. **As a Content Editor**, I want to fetch all recent TWN posts in bulk so that I can process multiple articles efficiently without manual downloading
2. **As a Content Editor**, I want to preview English and Malay content side-by-side so that I can quickly identify translation issues before publishing
3. **As a Content Editor**, I want to select multiple posts for batch translation so that I can process content efficiently during dedicated migration sessions
4. **As a Content Editor**, I want to see real-time progress during translation operations so that I can plan my work and identify any issues early
5. **As a Content Editor**, I want to make quick edits to translations before publishing so that I can maintain quality while preserving efficiency gains

### Secondary Persona: Project Manager
**Role**: Strategic oversight and process optimization
**Goals**: Maximize team productivity and ensure consistent output quality

**User Stories**:
1. **As a Project Manager**, I want to track processing metrics and completion rates so that I can optimize workflow and resource allocation
2. **As a Project Manager**, I want to ensure published content maintains SEO integrity so that HelloKahwin search performance is preserved
3. **As a Project Manager**, I want to bulk publish approved content to HelloKahwin so that I can coordinate publishing schedules efficiently

### Detailed Workflow: Primary Use Case
**Scenario**: Weekly bulk migration of 50 TWN articles to HelloKahwin

1. **Discovery Phase**: Editor connects to TWN WordPress API and fetches recent posts
2. **Preparation Phase**: System downloads content and media, stores locally with status tracking
3. **Translation Phase**: Editor selects posts for batch translation, monitors progress, reviews failures
4. **Review Phase**: Editor uses split-view preview to review translations, makes corrections as needed
5. **Publishing Phase**: Editor approves content and publishes to HelloKahwin as drafts or live posts
6. **Verification Phase**: System confirms successful publication and updates mapping records
